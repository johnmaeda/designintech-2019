### AI is an increasingly popular topic — we tend to fear it.

* China is leading in designing experiences at a scale and level of sophistication that astounds. 
* Most designers believe that visual designers will start to be replaced by AI in five years.
* There are three kinds of design. Classical Design, Design Thinking, and Computational Design. 
* A computational designer understands computation at the level of code and networks.
* A computational designer thinks critically about technology and its impact on people.
* A computational designer leverages AI as one of the their tools to co-construct new ideas.

>Many of us now expect our online activities to be recorded and analyzed, but we assume the physical spaces we inhabit are different. The data broker industry doesn’t see it that way. To them, even the act of walking down the street is a legitimate data set to be captured, catalogued and exploited. This slippage between the digital and physical matters not only because of privacy concerns—it also raises serious questions about ethics and power.” —[via SciAm, 2014](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/when-big-data-marketing-becomes-stalking/)

>Rather than assuming Terms of Service are equivalent to informed consent, platforms should offer opt-in settings where users can choose to join experimental panels. If they don’t opt in, they aren’t forced to participate. This could be similar to the array of privacy settings that already exist on these platforms. Platforms could even offer more granular options, to specify what kinds of research a user is prepared to participate in, from design and usability studies through to psychological and behavioral experiments.” —[via The Atlantic, 2014](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/07/the-test-we-canand-shouldrun-on-facebook/373819/)

>If you’re not thinking about the way systemic bias can be propagated through the criminal justice system or predictive policing, then it’s very likely that, if you’re designing a system based on historical data, you’re going to be perpetuating those biases.

Addressing that is much more than a technical fix. It’s not a question of just tweaking the numbers to try and remove systemic inequalities and biases.” —[via Wired, 2017](https://www.wired.com/story/why-ai-is-still-waiting-for-its-ethics-transplant/)

>There is no quick technical fix to bias. It’s really tempting to want to think that there’s going to be some type of silver-bullet solution that we can just tweak our algorithms or, you know, use different sorts of training data sets, or try to boost signal in particular ways. The problem of this is that it really doesn’t look to the deep social and historical issues that human data is made from.” —[via Microsoft, 2018](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/keeping-an-eye-on-ai-with-dr-kate-crawford/)

.sans[[**Counterfactual Explanations Without Opening the Black Box: Automated Decisions and the GDPR**](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3063289) by Sandra Wachter / Brent Mittelstadt / Chris Russell]

>Explanations of automated decisions need not hinge on the general public understanding how algorithmic systems function. Even though such interpretability is of great importance and should be pursued, explanations can, in principle, be offered without opening the black box. Looking at explanations as a means to help a data subject act rather than merely understand, one could gauge the scope and content of explanations according to the specific goal or action they are intended to support.

[Counterfactuals](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/ai-bias-black-box-sandra-wachter) describe a dependency on the external facts that lead to that decision without the need to convey the internal state or logic of an algorithm. As a result, counterfactuals serve as a minimal solution that bypasses the current technical limitations of interpretability, while striking a balance between transparency and the rights and freedoms of others (e.g. privacy, trade secrets).”
